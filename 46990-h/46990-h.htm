PREFACE.
</h2>

<hr class="quart"/>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropspan">t</span> may not be improper to observe, that this
Poem was originally offered, as an humble
mite from the author, towards the contributions,
then collecting, for the purpose of effecting
the Abolition of the Slave-Trade. It was,
however, thought, that, as a witness of the enormities
of that Traffic, his personal evidence
might be of more use to the cause than could
be produced by any work of imagination: he,
therefore, twice attended in that capacity.
</p>

<p>
The substance of the “Observations” was intended
to be attached to the Poem, as a set of
proofs and explanations. But it was decided
by those who had given their time and talents
to the subject, that the prose account, substantiated
by an affidavit, should precede the verses.
When, therefore, at a subsequent period,
the Poem was about to be published, wanting
the aid of the explanatory prose, it was thought
proper by the friends, whose kindness in the
absence of the author, looked over the publication
and its corrections, to bring the work
down, in some measure to the level of plain,
<span class="pageno target" title="vi" id="page-vi"></span>
prosaic comprehension. In the present edition,
something has been done to bring the
verses nearer to the first intention.
</p>

<div class="thought-break"></div>

<p>
It may be right to add, that, instead of
changing the form of the “Letters” it was
suggested as best to leave them in their original
state, <i>as a faithful picture of what was once
the practice of the Trade</i>. And, in the hope,
that this may be the last local and temporary
representation of the horrors of the abominable
Traffic, the writer cannot resist the opportunity
of saying, that he feels more gratifying
and solid satisfaction than he has ever before
experienced, or, perhaps, than ever can again
occur to him.

<p class="block-quote">
<i>The Guardian Genius of Africa calls a council of the
other presiding powers—describes to them the miseries
occasioned by European visitors—and proposes
to each of them, in his department, to rouze the different
demons of the climate, and arm them to punish
the invaders on board the approaching vessel.—The
morbific plagues crowd to the vindictive standard,
and, taking Death for their leader, stand embattled
on the shore.—The vessel arrives and anchors.—Native
agents are allured, and go out on the business of
the voyage.—Slaves are brought down to the vessel—are
examined—purchased—put on board—and confined
below.—Death, at the head of his legions, beholds
the scene.—Dispatches Cruelty from the ranks
to take possession of the master's heart.—Effects of
this union on the crew.—The whole pestiferous body
advance to the attack.—Progress of the sickness
among the crew.—Death of Russel.—The contagion
spreads.—Dishonours of the dead.—Address

had the dishonour to be employed
in the Slave-Trade, and having been for
some time resident in a factory up the country,
observations and facts have occurred, that
may add a little to the mass of materials, your
humanity has been at such labour to collect;
and which has already thrown so much light
on a traffic, that from its commencement to its
close, is marked with a rapacity and oppression,
unequalled in any, the most horrid process
of individual or collective guilt, that has
stained the page of history. The epistolary
form will be an apt medium for a few observations,
where there is no time for a logical
arrangement, and my addressing of them to a
Gentleman, to whose energy and elucidations
the cause is so much indebted, will be allowed
the claim of propriety at least, and I hope will
meet with your excuse. Without taking up
<span class="pageno target" title="46" id="page-46"></span>
your time by a longer preface, I will hasten to
my remarks, commencing with as early a stage
of the bussiness as possible, so that they may,
as far as circumstances will allow, connect
the whole round of a <span class="sc">Guinea Voyage</span>.
</p>

<p>
I have been the readier to take up my pen,
when I consider the impenetrable veil that has
been thrown over this traffic for such a number
of years. Its principle, its process, and its
effects, have been with-held from the public eye
by every effort that interest, ingenuity, and influence,
could devise. It would be but a natural
question in this place, were it asked, How it
is possible that a trade, which has been carried
on so long, and in such an open manner,
whose effects are every day before us, and to continue,
which such a number of people are employed,
can be marked with such uncommon
circumstances of cruelty, injustice, murder,
and oppression, as have been usually laid to
its charge?
</p>

<p>
That the remark is specious, I do not mean
to deny; and many, I fear, have too hastily
made up their minds on the subject from this
consideration alone. But let me also ask a
question or two in return. From whom is it
expected that this information should be derived?
Who are the persons qualified to produce
the authentic evidence? Will the merciful
slave-merchant step forward, and give up
the long catalogue of rapacity, murder, and
destruction, his own avarice has framed; Will
<span class="pageno target" title="47" id="page-47"></span>
the humane Guinea-Captain produce his fatal
muster-roll,—and for once impelled by justice,
change that <i>useful</i> disease,—<i>Flux</i>, <i>Flux</i>, <i>Flux</i>,
which has hitherto so conveniently masked
the death-list of his devoted crew, to the <i>real</i>,
the mortal causes, that have thinned his ship?
Will petty officers, bravely despising all thoughts
of preferment, disregarding the opinion of
owners and agents, and nobly resolving to pass
their lives in labour, wretchedness, and servile
dependance—will they disclose the horrid
scenes they have been witnesses to—the
barbarities they have seen practised, and the
cruelties, of which, they themselves have been,
perhaps, the unwilling instruments? And yet
we have information on the subject: information
in newspapers, in pamphlets, in coffee-houses,
and on 'change; on the warrantable,
the political, the humane process of the Slave-Trade.
Heavens!—Through <i>what</i> channels
must flow the sullied accounts that are thus
thrown before us? Through the self interested
affirmations of <i>Traders</i>; through <i>Captains</i>,
whose continuance in the employ depends
on their open attachment and defence of the
proceedings of their owners; through <i>Captains</i>,
I say, who hope to be Traders, and through
<i>Mates</i>, who hope to be Captains.
</p>

<p>
Why those, who through inclination, and
having no favour to purchase, nor interest to
support, and who might be supposed to give
the truth in plain, unbiassed information, are
<span class="pageno target" title="48" id="page-48"></span>
not produced in such multitudes as our adversaries
demand, I shall endeavour to prove impossible,
from the nature of the trade, and the
unremitting pains taken to prevent their returning
to the port from which they sailed.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose, I must pass over all the
destruction and barbarity of the voyage, and
meet the few meagre survivors on their arrival
in the West-Indies. Here they are bound
by their articles<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, to receive half their wages
in the currency of the island. This is a two-fold
grievance. They are robbed of as much
hardly-earned money, as makes the difference
between currency and sterling, which is
far from being an inconsiderable loss. But
there is a farther mischief attendant on this
injustice. Imagine to yourself, Sir, a poor
worn-out wretch, after the miseries and sickness
of a <i>slaving voyage</i>—after a long want of
every cheering beverage—now first set ashore—his
own master—among people of his own
colour and language—with money in his pocket,
and temptations to excess on every side:
picture this—and for a moment recollect the
unsuspecting, thoughtless, dissipated propensity
that marks the character of a British sailor,
and must you not conclude the consequence
as anavoidable—that the feeble remains left,
by the cruelty and disease of an <i>African voyage</i>,
are speedily sacrificed by West Indian intemperance?
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="49" id="page-49"></span>
</div>

<p>
From death and desertion, <i>thus encouraged</i>,
few escape. I went out in a certain vessel; the
crew consisted of thirty-two or upwards; she
was designed to be left on the coast as a floating
factory. A fresh ship of 300 tons, was
sent out to bring off the purchase to the West
Indies, with a crew to replace our dead. The
captain of the latter, and a few to make trade
were left on the coast; the rest embarked with
us for the West Indies—of the two crews,
there came home but the captain, the carpenter,
and myself.
</p>

<p>
By such means, they get rid of those who
might call them to an account for their barbarities—and
the money due to those, whom
they have obliged to desert, is saved to their
owners. The mortality, usually ascribed to a
Guinea voyage, stops or lessens the proper inquiries
about the fate of the crew. Besides,
improvident, heedless sailors, seldom give their
friends a line of advice, relative to the port
they sail from, or on what particular voyage
they are bound; especially a voyage that is
held in so much dishonour and contempt.
Though I remained a long time in Liverpool,
after our arrival, there were inquiries but after
four persons out of the two crews above
mentioned, and one of those was from Falmouth,
and the other from the farther part of
Wales. And I am convinced, (for I managed
all their little accounts) that of the first crew,
officers excepted, not one of them had sent
<span class="pageno target" title="50" id="page-50"></span>
their friends the smallest account of their destination.
Thus, silently, does the nation lose
her most useful subjects: and in this manner
is the public deprived of an impartial channel
of information, and of the means of developing
a system of iniquity, from the flimsy web,
in which it has so long been veiled by sophistry
and misrepresentation.

The practice of Liverpool, the only port I sailed from in that employ.
</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="letter">LETTER</span> II.</h3>

<p>
<span class="dropspan">It</span> has been asserted, that the Slave Trade
is a desirable employ, and a nursery for our
seamen.
</p>

<p>
Were this the case, sailors would be found
as willing to offer themselves to this, as to any
other traffic. But the direct contrary is the
fact. Nothing is more difficult than to procure
a sufficient number of hands for a Guinea
voyage.
</p>

<p>
To collect a crew for this purpose, there are
public houses, under the influence, and in the
pay of the merchants; every allurement and
artifice is held out to entice them into these
infamous dens. Festivity and music lay hold
of the deluded senses; prostitution throws in
a fascinating spell with too much success; and
intoxication generally gives the business its fatal
period.
</p>

<p>
In these houses, every temptation to run
<span class="pageno target" title="51" id="page-51"></span>
into debt is most studiously offered; this, with
an unthinking sailor, is easily brought about:
and when once that wheel is set in motion, it
is soon accelerated to the wretched point which
was aimed at. When the debt is sufficient
for the purpose, a Guinea ship is offered, sometimes
through the medium of the inexorable
hostess, and frequently by one of those numerous
agents on that business, who, under
the mask of pity or sudden friendship, win
the attention and confidence of the unsuspecting
victim. If this be refused, he is thrown
into prison, which fixes him their own; for,
from that place, other vessels will scarcely engage
him; ships in every other employ find
seamen willing enough to <i>offer</i> their services:
and the Captains of these have a natural objection
to what they call <i>jail-birds</i>.
</p>

<p>
These houses are kept in continual operation.
But, at the immediate time of an outfit,
every exertion and contrivance is used. Merchants,
Clerks, Captains, and others, prowl
about without intermission. They lay hold
of every sailor they meet, and without ceremony,
hurry him into some scene of intoxication.
I have been dragged into houses three
times, in the course of one street, myself: nay,
I have known many seamen, who fancied
themselves cunning enough to evade these
practices, go with the crimps to some of their
houses, boasting that they would cheat the
Merchant out of a night's merriment, and
<span class="pageno target" title="52" id="page-52"></span>
firmly resolved to oppose every artifice that
could be offered; yet have they, in their state
of drunkenness, signed articles with the very
men, whose purposes they were aware of, and
have been plunged into a situation, of which
they had known the horrors.
</p>

<p>
In Liverpool—and I understand that the
same practice prevails at Bristol—when they
have signed articles, they get a note for their
advance-money, not payable till they are out
at sea, and till a list of the crew is brought
back by the pilot. Now, to negotiate this
bill, which is to pay their debts, and to furnish
themselves with a few clothes, and a
little modicum of liquor, they are obliged to
make a will, and power of attorney, in favour
of their rapacious landlady. The third
mate of the vessel I sailed in—poor <i>Russel</i>!—and
myself, were obliged to give into this
practice. Without any idea of debt, and far
from any of those hired dens I have mentioned,
but rather reputably lodged in what
they called a coffee-house, we found it absolutely
necessary, in order to live with any degree
of ease and comfort, to make wills in
favour of our landlady: it was expected as a
thing of course, and was impossible to be avoided
moderately. Her brewer, a man of
credit, was the witness and leader of the business
and seemed to consider it as an essential
consequence of the voyage. It is true,
we cancelled them soon by new ones: but
<span class="pageno target" title="53" id="page-53"></span>
this may serve to shew the prevalency of the
practice, and may help to exhibit to the public,
the disinterested characters of that numerous
body of men, women, and children,
who have with such cogent arguments signed
the Liverpool petition against the abolition of
the Slave Trade:—those whip-cord spinners,
those chain-forgers, those heirs and legatees,
deriving inheritance from the cruelty, murder,
and injustice of a Guinea voyage.
</p>

<h3><span class="letter">LETTER</span> III.</h3>

<p>
<span class="dropspan">Till</span> the vessel gets clear of the channel—till
there is no probability that contrary winds
or inclemency of weather will drive her back
into an English port, the usage of the seamen
is moderate, and their allowance of provisions
sufficient: in short, the conduct of the
Captain and officers appears like that which is
the <i>continual</i> practice in every other employ.
But as soon as they are fairly out at sea, and
there is no moral possibility of desertion, or
application for justice, then the scene is shifted.
Their ratio of provisions is shortened to
the very verge of famine; their allowance of
water lessened to the extreme of existence; nothing
but incessant labour, a burning climate,
unremitting cruelty, and every species of oppression
is before them.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="54" id="page-54"></span>
</div>

<p>
This no exaggerated language, nor is it
the picture but of one particular case: every
one I have ever spoken with, that was qualified
to answer on the subject (and there should
be little account made of any other) has declared
that the usage was alike, with but a
few exceptions. What I saw and felt myself,
I have a right to declare; and I think it may
be assumed as the average medium of the general
conduct of the African employ; for I
have heard of very many instances of greater
cruelty and destruction; and a few where the
usage has been better.
</p>

<p>
We were fortunate in a leaky vessel, and
bad weather: the apprehension that we should
be obliged to bear away for Lisbon, kept back
our misery for awhile. Flogging did not commence
with us till about the latitude 28°. It
was talked of long before, but was with-held
by the above-mentioned consideration. It no
sooner made its appearance but it spread like
a contagion. Wantonness, misconception, and
ignorance, inflicted it without an appearance
of remorse, and without fear of being answerable
for the abuse of authority. This
barbarous charge to the officers I myself heard
given “You are now in a Guinea ship—no
seaman, though you speak harshly, must
dare to give you a saucy answer—<i>that</i> is out
of the question; but if they <span class="small">LOOK</span> to displease
you, knock them down.”
</p>

<p>
The cruel direction was soon put in practice,
<span class="pageno target" title="55" id="page-55"></span>
by one of the mates, on the cooper, a most
harmless, hard-working, worthy creature. The
mate knocked him down for some light answer
he gave him, for the poor fellow had an
innocent aim at being humourous. On his
making his way to appeal to the Captain, he
was knocked down again: crawling on the
deck, his face covered with blood, he still persisted
to make his way to the cabin, but was
struck to the deck a third and a fourth time,
when some of the sailors rushed between, and
hurried him away.
</p>

<p>
Scarce an hour passed in any day without
flogging; sometimes three were tied up together.
The slightest imputation of error brought
on the bitter punishment; and sometimes the
smarting application of pickle was superadded.
</p>

<p>
I do not now exactly remember the allowance
of bread: at first I know it was five lbs.
per week, served out every Sunday (<i>the only
circumstance that distinguished the Sabbath through
the whole voyage</i>) but it was soon lessened.
This I very well remember, that many of the
people had their whole week's proportion <a id="eaten"></a>eaten
up by Tuesday morning; and the daily
weight of beef was so small, that though there
was not water to allay the thirst it occasioned,
we never dared to steep it for fear of wasting
the quantity.
</p>

<p>
During the first part of the passage, our
allowance of water was three pints per day:
for the last month it was reduced to one quart,
<span class="pageno target" title="56" id="page-56"></span>
wine measure. A quart of water in the torrid
zone!―In the calms, which are prevalent
in this latitude, we were in the boat, towing,
from morning till night: happy used I to think
myself, though almost fainting with fatigue,
if a little sweat dropped from my forehead,
that I might catch it in my mouth to moisten
my parched tongue. The licking the dew off
the hencoops, in a morning, had been long a
delicious secret; but my monopoly was at last
found out, and my little refreshment laid open
to numbers. Many of the men could not refrain,
but in a kind of temporary distraction,
drank up their whole allowance the moment
they received it; and remained for the next
four and twenty hours in a state of raging
thirst not to be described. The doctor declared
that this want of water, in such a climate,
and living entirely on salt provisions, must
lead to the most fatal consequences.
</p>

<p>
During this scarcity with the men, the captain,
besides plenty of beer and wine, had a
large tea-kettle full of water every morning,
and another every evening, added to his allowance.
I know there was no want in the cabin,
for the third mate, who was my friend, frequently
gave me a little out of his own portion.
</p>

<p>
The scarcity of water is a common case: it
is owing to the vessel's being stowed so full of
goods for the trade, that room for necessaries
is made but a secondary consideration. The
occasion of this conduct appears to me to be
<span class="pageno target" title="57" id="page-57"></span>
principally this: A certain number of slaves
are to be carried to the West-Indies; but before
that number can be landed there, the
owners are well aware how many are likely to
be marked on the dead list, for the purchase
of which, there must be goods sent out, as well
as for the probable number that speculation
has fixed to come to market. For this reason
every corner and cranny is crammed with articles
of traffic; to this consideration is bent
every exertion of labour and ingenuity; and
the health and lives of the seamen, as of no
value, have but little weight in the estimation.
</p>

<p>
Besides the inexpressible misery of wanting
water in such a climate, there is another very
material hardship attending this avaricious accumulation
of cargo. The vessel is so crowded
with goods, that the sailors have no room
to sling their hammocks and bedding. Before
they leave the cold latitudes they lie up and
down, on chests and cables, but when they
come nearer the influence of the potent sun,
they sleep upon deck, exposed to all the malignity
of the heavy and unwholesome dews.
</p>

<p>
The advocates for the Slave-Trade endeavour
to advance, that the mortality of the seamen
is entirely to be attributed to the nature of the
climate—but this assertion, is founded neither
in veracity nor experience. The climate comes
in for its share in <i>heightening</i> the horrid scene,
but it is the previously wretched situation of
the poor victims that gives it that effect. I heard
<span class="pageno target" title="58" id="page-58"></span>
our doctor, an able intelligent man, declare,
that if the trade, with the same concomitant
circumstances, was carried on at the Canary
Islands, the same mortality would be the consequence.
And I am fully convinced, that if
a commerce was carried on to the coast of Africa
of any other kind than that of slaving,
and the captains treated their people with as
much humanity as they are treated in other
employs, not one of the causes of the great
mortality, I have been witness to, could exist.
</p>

<p>
Among the many causes of destruction,
which originate from the trade, and not from
the climate, the bulk-heads between the decks,
excluding a salutary circulation of air, have
been insisted upon as producing these effects.
But there is another which has not claimed
such notice, and which yet is a terrible assistant
to African mortality. This is the fabricating
of an house over the vessel for the security
of slaves, while on the coast.
</p>

<p>
This enclosure helps the stagnation of air,
and is, in that point of view, dreadful: but it
is more fatal in the act of its preparation. I
know nothing more destructive than the business
of cutting wood and bamboe, for the
purpose of erecting and thatching this structure.
The process is generally by the riverside.
The faces and bodies of the poor seamen
are exposed to the fervour of a burning
sun, for a covering would be insupportable.
They are immersed up to the waist in mud and
<span class="pageno target" title="59" id="page-59"></span>
slime; pestered by snakes, worms, and venomous
reptiles; tormented by muskitoes, and a
thousand assailing insects; their feet slip from
under them at every stroke, and their relentless
officers do not allow a moment's intermission
from the painful task. This employment,
the cruelty of the officers, and the inconceivably
shocking task of scraping the contagious
blood and filth, at every opportunity, from the
places where the slaves lie, are, in my opinion,
the three greatest (though by no means
the sole) causes of the destruction of seamen,
which this country experiences by the prosecution
of the trade in slaves.
</p>

<h3><span class="letter">LETTER</span> IV.
</h3>

<p>
<span class="dropspan">As</span> I wish to meet and to answer every possible
question that may be asked about this
simple enumeration of facts, I find two plausible
interrogations that may with no great impropriety
be stated in the present place.
</p>

<p> “How is it possible that captains should be
so inattentive to their own and their employer's
interests, as to sacrifice the very
men who are to assist them in the main business
of the voyage—or, if headlong cruelty
prompts them to such a hazard, by what
means is the complicated laborious business
ever finished?”
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="60" id="page-60"></span>
</div>

<p>
Again—“If by some extraneous means the
traffic is completed, who are then to take
care of the slaves, and how are the vessels
navigated to the different Western Colonies,
to which they are bound?” Of these two
queries the latter I shall reserve to a future discussion,
and confine myself, at present, to the
former.
</p>

<p>
There is on that part of Africa, called the
Gold Coast, a race of the inhabitants, known
by the name of Fantees; they are sturdy, animated,
laborious, and full of courage. Many
of this nation are reared from their childhood,
in the European vessels that frequent
the coast; they learn their languages, and are
practised in all the habits of seamanship; and
more especially all that relate to the business
of <i>slaving</i>. Vessels on, or near their own coast,
they of course assist for a stipulated hire: those
that are destined for any of the trading places
in the gulph of Benin, or farther down the
coast, generally call here and engage a Fantee
mate, boatswain, and crew, from fifteen to
thirty or upwards, according to the size of the
vessel. The captain enters into a written agreement
with their king, which is counter-signed
by the English governor, expressing the
nature of their service, the amount of their
wages, and an engagement not to carry any
of them off to the West-Indies. To these men
the trade is in a good measure indebted for its
existence. When the poor sailors fall off, these
<span class="pageno target" title="61" id="page-61"></span>
hardy natives, who have every indulgence the
captains can allow them, carry on the business
with a vigour and activity, of which the British
seamen, from their ill usage and scanty
fare, are incapable.
</p>

<p>
The manner of trading on every part of the
coast differs, I dare say, in some particulars,
but its general nature is pretty much the same:
and as it has been so copiously handled in other
publications on this subject, I shall forbear
to speak on that head; reserving a liberty
of animadverting on any thing that may
have been but slightly handled.
</p>

<p>
I am inclined to think, <a id="methodof"></a>that the method of
collecting slaves by war, and frequent battles,
dreadful as that mode may be, is by no means
the great support of the Slave Trade: but that
they are procured by the still more infamous
and horrid practice of <i>kidnapping</i>.
</p>

<p>
In Benin, where I was employed, I am certain
it was often the case. Our factory, in
which I resided, was at Gatoe, many miles
from the sea, in the heart of the country. I
made continual enquiries, but never heard of
any wars. I understood, however, from every
thing I could collect, that they were seized by
fraud or violence in the internal parts of the
country, and so transmitted through different
hands to the immediate traders upon the coast.
</p>

<p>
But to put it out of conjecture, the business
was in practice every day around us. There
was a lawless body of men in the kingdom of
<span class="pageno target" title="62" id="page-62"></span>
Benin, called <i>Joemen</i>; who, encouraged by
the white traders, erected themselves into
an independent government. Their king, a
desperate fellow, was called <i>Badjeka</i>. They
had no towns nor villages, but shifted suddenly,
and pitched their temporary huts where
they considered it to be most opportune for
their depredations. These banditti bought no
slaves, but they sold multitudes. They had
neither settlement nor plantations, but lived
entirely by this horrid species of robbery,
which, in a civilized country, like <i>Benin</i>, must
have been attended every day with circumstances
of cruelty and distress, beyond any thing
that enthusiasm (for so the adoption of the
cause of humanity is called by the cold-blooded
spoilers) has ever yet imagined.
</p>

<p>
Among the islands and creeks that are numerous
about the mouth of the river <i>Formosa</i>,
there was also a kind of pirate admiral, distinguished
by the name and title of captain
<i>Lemma-Lemma</i>. This personage had a powerful
fleet of war canoes, with which he made
descents on all parts of the unprotected coast;
he paid no taxes, but declared himself independent
of the king of Benin, whose subjects
he carried off for trade at every opportunity.
To this man, and his exertions, we were a good
deal indebted for our cargo.
</p>

<p>
Whenever we wanted to give the trade a
desirable degree of celerity, <a id="wasto"></a>the practice was, to
declare that a certain number of prime commodities
<span class="pageno target" title="63" id="page-63"></span>
would be in trade till such a date, (a
short one) and no longer;—or, that the vessel
was to sail by such a day, and was to be
replaced by no other for some time. These
artifices were sure to produce the effect proposed:
we had soon slaves brought down to us,
in great numbers, and without the intervention
of wars or battles.
</p>

<p>
It has been affirmed by those, who know
nothing of the internal policy and constitution
of <i>Guinea</i>, but perhaps too much of that of
the West India islands, that though they allow
a number of <i>Africans</i> are annually sacrificed
in the act of capture, in the course of
the passage, in the seasoning in the plantations,
and a long <i>et cætera</i>; yet that the slavish
state of the <i>survivors</i> is infinitely preferable to
that which they experienced in their own
country.
</p>

<p>
The arguments drawn from the unalienable
rights and principles of civil liberty, I leave in
the hands of those who have time and abilities
to enforce, and science to illuminate their
reasonings—and, thank heaven, such have engaged
in the cause of humanity! My simple
observations go no further than to declare,
that through the course of a seafaring life, to
almost all parts of Europe, the West Indies,
and North America, I never saw a happier
race of people than those of the kingdom of
<span class="sc">Benin</span>.
</p>

<p>
The subjects of the king of Benin were, during
<span class="pageno target" title="64" id="page-64"></span>
my observations there, seated in ease and
plenty. The slave trade, and its unavoidably
bad effects excepted, every thing bore the appearance
of friendship, tranquillity, and primitive
independence. At <i>Gatoe</i> the markets
were regular and well stocked: they teemed
with luxuries unknown to the Europeans. Their
fishermen, hunters, and husbandmen, brought
in their stores and delicacies: their smiths,
carpenters, weavers, and, believe me, there
are such among them, displayed their curious
manufactures. Fowls, fish, fresh and dried provisions,
fruits of the most delicious kind, various
sorts of pepper and spices, potatoes, yams,
plantains, calavances, cocoa nuts, sugar-cane,
purslane, calliloo, ocra, palm-wine, and palm-oil,
were in plenty there. These added to native
coral, mats of a most curious texture,
Benin and Jaboe cloths of beautiful colours,
ivory, gold-dust, gums, woods, wax, cotton,
and other commodities, proved to a demonstration
the inexaustible store of valuable articles,
which they could substitute for the unnatural
traffic in human flesh; and shewed incontestably,
that they could improve their produce
to a state worthy the return of British
luxuries. The glare and relish of these luxuries,
Sir, now grown essential to them by use,
they cannot easily forego; but if the inhuman
process were abolished, they would be under
the necessity, and would be desirous of meeting
your exports with some more valuable and
more guiltless branch of trade.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="65" id="page-65"></span>
</div>

<h3><span class="letter">LETTER</span> V.
</h3>

<p>
<span class="dropspan">It</span> is unaccountable, but it is certainly true,
that the moment a Guinea captain comes in
sight of this shore, the Demon cruelty seems
to fix his residence within him. Soon after
we arrived, there came on board us a master of
a vessel, who was commissioned joint factor
with our captain. All that I could conceive
of barbarity fell short of the stories I heard of
this man. His whole delight was in giving pain.
</p>

<p>
While our captain was placing buoys and
other directions on the dangerous bar of the
river, for the purpose of crossing it, he used
to order the men to be flogged without an imputation
of the smallest crime. The steward,
for serving out some red wine to a sick man,
by the doctor's direction, was flogged in such
a manner, as not to be able to let his shirt
touch his mangled back; and after his punishment,
making an attempt to explain the matter,
he was ordered to the shrowds again,
and the same number of lashes was repeated.
</p>

<p>
It was his common practice to call his cabin-boy
to him, and without the smallest provocation,
to tear his face, ears, and neck, in
the most brutal manner. I have seen him
thrust his fingers into his mouth, and force
them against the inside of his cheek till the
wound appeared on the outside of the same.
<span class="pageno target" title="66" id="page-66"></span>
He had pulled his ears so much, that they became
of a monstrous size. The hind part of
them was torn from the head. They had a
continual soreness and running, and were not
well near a twelvemonth after his infernal tormentor's
death, when he deserted from us in
the West Indies. I heard many and uncommon
stories of the barbarity of this monster
to his own crew, but had an opportunity
to see but little of him, for he lived
but eleven days after he came on board us;
he killed himself with our wine and beer; of
which he had not tasted any for a long time
before our arrival there.
</p>

<p>
At the commencement of our trade, I went
up to the factory, where I continued about
eight months. In the course of this time most
of the crew fell the sacrifices of this horrid traffick,
and its inseparable cruelties. One evening
only was I on board during this period: but
this was sufficient to give me a strong idea of
the misery I had so happily escaped. The vessel,
as Mr. Falconbridge aptly and emphatically
observes, was like a slaughter-house. Blood,
filth, misery, and disease. The chief mate
lay dying, calling out for that comfort and assistance
he had so often denied to others. He
was glad to lay hold of me to bring him a little
refreshment—no one else to take the smallest
notice of his cries. The doctor was in the
same condition, and making the same complaint.
The second mate was lying on his back
<span class="pageno target" title="67" id="page-67"></span>
on the medicine-chest; his head hanging down
over one end of it, his hair sweeping the deck,
and clotted with the filth that was collected
there; and in this unnoticed situation he died
soon after I came on board.
</p>

<p>
On the poop the appearance was still more
shocking—the remainder of the ship's crew
stretched in the last stage of their sickness,
without comfort, without refreshment, without
attendance. There they lay, straining
their weak voices with the most lamentable
cries for a little water, and not a soul to afford
them the smallest relief. And while all this
horror and disease were preying on the lives
of the poor seamen, the business of purchasing,
messing the slaves, and every circumsance
relative to the trade, was transacting with as
little interruption, and as much unconcern, as
if no such people had ever been on board. I
passed a night of misery with them, and got
up the river with the morning's boat—another
night might have sealed me among the
number of the devoted crew.
</p>

<p>
To provide against this mortality, and to convey
the purchase to the West Indies, (which
makes the answer to the second query of my
fourth letter) a fine large ship, and a fresh crew,
were sent out to us. The new captain, and a
few to make trade, (as I remarked before)
were left behind in the factory. About five
of the old crew, all that were now <i>left</i>, and
in the last stage of illness, were brought
<span class="pageno target" title="68" id="page-68"></span>
off with us. In this fresh ship, and with this
fresh crew we left the coast, and entered on
what is called the <i>Middle Passage</i>.
</p>

<p>
This horrid portion of the voyage was but
one continued scene of barbarity, unremitting
labour, mortality, and disease. Flogging, as
in the outward passage, was a principal amusement
in this.
</p>

<p>
The captain was so feeble that he could not
move, but was obliged to be carried up and
down: yet his illness, so far from abating his
tyranny, seemed rather to increase it. When
in this situation, he has often asked the persons
who carried him whether they could judge of
the torment he was in? and being answered,
No—he has laid hold of their faces, and darting
his nails into their cheeks with all his
strength; on the person's crying out with the
pain, he would then add, with the malignity
of a demon, “There,—that is to give you a
taste of what I feel.” He had always a parcel
of trade knives within his reach, which he
would also dart at them with ferocity on the
most trifling occasions.
</p>

<p>
The bed of this wretch, which he kept for
weeks together, was in one corner of the cabin,
and raised to a good height from the
deck. To the posts of this bed he would order
those to be tied that were to be flogged, so
that their faces almost met his, and there he
lay, enjoying their agonizing screams, while
their flesh was lacerated without mercy: this
<span class="pageno target" title="69" id="page-69"></span>
was a frequent and a favourite mode of punishment.
</p>

<p>
The chief mate, whom we brought off the
coast, died soon; the second mate soon after:
their united duties devolved upon me. While
the latter was in his illness, he got up one
night, made a noise, tumbled some things about
the half-deck, untied a hammock, and
played some other delirious but innocent tricks.
The captain, being a little recovered at that
time, came out, and knocked him down. I do
not at this time remember the weapon, but I
know his head was sadly cut, and bleeding—in short,
he was beat in a most dreadful manner;
and, before the morning, he <i>was dead</i>.
This man had not been many weeks on the
coast, and left it in remarkable good health.
</p>

<p>
The cook, one day, burned some meat in
the roasting: he was called to the cabin on
that account, and beaten most violently with
the spit. He begged and cried for mercy, but
without effect, until the strength of his persecutor
was exhausted. He crawled some where—<i>but
never did duty afterwards</i>. He died in a
day or two!
</p>

<p>
The poor creatures, as our numbers were
thinned, were obliged to work when on the very
verge of death. The <i>certainty</i>, that they
could not live a day longer, did not procure
them a grain of mercy. The boatswain, who
had left the coast a healthy, hearty man, had
been seized with the flux: he was in the last
<span class="pageno target" title="70" id="page-70"></span>
stage of it, but no remission from work was
allowed him. He grew at last so bad, that the
mucus, blood, and whole strings of his intestines
came from him without intermission.
Yet, even in this situation—when he could not
stand—he was forced to the wheel, to steer a
large vessel; an arduous duty, that in all likelihood
<a id="too"></a>would have required two men, had we
had people enough for the purpose. He was
placed upon one of the mess-tubs, as not being
able to stand, and that he might not dirty
the deck. He remained at this painful duty as
long as he could move his hands—he died on
the same night! The body was, as usual, thrown
overboard, without any covering but the shirt.
It grew calm in the night, and continued to be
so for a good part of the next day—in the
morning <a id="corps"></a>his corpse was discovered floating along
side, and kept close to us for some hours—it
was a horrid spectacle, and seemed to give
us an idea of the body of a victim, calling out
to heaven for vengeance on our barbarity!
</p>

<p>
As the crew fell off, an accumulated weight
of labour pressed upon the few survivors—and,
towards the end of the middle passage, all
idea of keeping the slaves in chains was given
up; for there was not strength enough left among
all the white men, to pull a single rope
with effect. The slaves (at least a great number
of them) were therefore freed from their
irons, and <i>they</i> pulled and hawled as they were
directed by the inefficient sailors. We were
<span class="pageno target" title="71" id="page-71"></span>
fortunate in having favourable weather: a
smart gale of wind, such as with an able crew
would not have created us more trouble than
reefing our sails a little, must have inevitably
sent us to destruction, and added us to a numerous
list of people, that have perished in
the same circumsances; but which list has
been kept from the public eye by the most
studied circumspection.
</p>

<p>
In this state of weakness, it may be readily
supposed, that but little attention can be paid
to those whose approach to the last stage of
their misery renders them helpless, and in
want of aid: I remember that a man, who
was ill, had one night crawled out of his hammock;
he was so weak that he could not get
back, but laid himself down on the gratings.
There was <a id="him"></a>no person to assist him.—In the
morning, when I came upon the main deck—(I
shudder at the bare recollection) he was still
alive, but covered with blood—the hogs had
picked his toes to the bone, and his body was
otherwise mangled by them in a manner too
shocking to relate.
</p>

<h3><span class="letter">LETTER</span> VI.
</h3>

<p>
<span class="dropspan">Though</span> the unabating cruelty, exercised
upon <i>seamen</i> in the Slave Trade, first prompted
me to give in my mite of information to
<span class="pageno target" title="72" id="page-72"></span>
the cause, yet it may not be thought foreign
to the subject to make a few remarks on
the treatment of the <i>slaves</i>. Mr. <i>Falconbridge</i>'s
account, which carries truth and conviction
on the face of it, gives a most just description
of their package, diet, and treatment.
But no pen, no abilities, can give more
than a very faint resemblance of the horrid situation.
One <i>real</i> view—one <span class="small">MINUTE</span>, absolutely
spent in the slave rooms on the middle
passage, would do more for the cause of humanity,
than the pen of a <i>Robertson</i>, or the
whole collective eloquence of the British senate.
</p>

<p>
That interest must operate on the captain to
treat the slaves with kindness, has been advanced
by those who have cogent reasons for wishing
the continuance of this trade: but, like
most of the arguments they advance, it has
more of speciousness than of truth. The infernal
passions, that seem to be nourished in the
very vitals of this employ, bid defiance to every
power of controul. Humanity, justice,
religion, have long lost their influence there.
But even <span class="small">AVARICE</span>, the author of the destructive
business, when struggling with <span class="small">CRUELTY</span>,
loses its force, and finds its powers of dominion
foiled by the very monster it self produced.
</p>

<p>
The slaves, with regard to attention to their
health and diet, claim, from the purpose of the
voyage, a consideration superior to the seamen:
but when the <a id="iracible"></a>capricious and irascible
passions of their general tyrant were once set
<span class="pageno target" title="73" id="page-73"></span>
afloat, I never could see any difference in the
cruelty of their treatment.
</p>

<p>
Flogging, that favourite exercise, was in continual
use with the poor Negroes as well as the
seamen. So incessant was the practice, that
it is impossible to discriminate the particular
occasions or circumstances. One or two,
however, I may mention.
</p>

<p>
Just before we left the coast, and when the
rooms were so crowded, that the slaves were
packed together to a degree of pain, there came
a boat-load of slaves along-side in the night,
after all those on board had been put below.
The new comers were also put down, to shift
for themselves, and of course much noise ensued.
In the womens' room, this was sadly
increased by one of the strangers being so unfortunate
<a id="asto"></a>as to throw down a certain tub. In the
morning she was tied up to the captain's bed,
with her face close to his, and a person was
ordered to flog her. The idea of the sex operating
on the unwilling executioner, she did
not receive her punishment with all the severity
that was expected. The executioner was
himself immediately tied up, and for the lenity
he had shewn, received a violent lashing.
The woman was then flogged till her back was
full of holes. I remember, that in healing
them, they were so thick, that I was forced
to cut two or three of them into one, to apply
the dressings.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="74" id="page-74"></span>
</div>

<p>
That the chief tortures are applied to the
unhappy sufferers, on refusing the diet that is
offered them, has been fully mentioned by others.
We had our share of them; and the
lash was often inflicted until the poor victims
fainted away with pain. Two women, by many
degrees the two finest slaves in the ship,
felt a severity of this kind with such poignancy,
that folding themselves in each others
arms, they plunged over the poop of the vessel
into the sea, and were drowned. We were
obliged to put all the women immediately below,
as they cried out in a most affecting manner,
and many of them were preparing to follow
their companions. These are the people
whom the good trader's represent, as wanting
every kind of sensibility!
</p>

<p>
Were I to transcribe a regular journal of the
usage of the slaves on the middle passage, it
would be but a repetition of acts similar to the
above, and varied perhaps only by the circumstances
that attended it. One instance more of
brutality I would, however, willingly relate,
as practiced by the captain on an unfortunate
slave, of the age of eight or nine, but that I
am <i>obliged</i> to withhold it; for though my heart
bleeds at the recollection, though the act
is too atrocious and bloody to be passed over
in silence, yet as I cannot express it in any
words that would not severely wound the feelings
of the <i>delicate</i> reader, I must be content
<span class="pageno target" title="75" id="page-75"></span>
with suffering it to escape among those numerous
hidden and unrevealed enormities, the offspring
of barbarity and despotism, that are
committed daily in the prosecution of this execrable
trade.
</p>

<p>
Before I quit this subject of the Slaves, I
must mention a circumstance that, I dare say
very often occurs, though perhaps seldom with
so advantageous a succedaneum. The doctor
and his mate being both dead, the medicine
chest was given into my charge and disposal:
a knowledge of Latin, and a little medical
reading, were all my qualifications. What a
situation would it have been for an ignorant,
an unfeeling, or an indolent man! Medicines
or poisons to be dealt out promiscuously to
such a number of persons, all afflicted with
disease, during a passage through the tedious
latitudes across the Atlantic. The only directions
I had to go by, were a few remarks
on the last stage of the flux, written in a minute
or two, by a surgeon at St. Thomas's, on
a bit of cartridge paper.
</p>

<h3><span class="letter">LETTER</span> VII.</h3>

<p>
<span class="dropspan">The</span> principles of the Slave Trade, and the
conduct of the officers on the voyage, are
<span class="pageno target" title="76" id="page-76"></span>
<i>alike</i>, in all the cases I have met with, whether
from actual knowledge, or well-attested information.
Publications therefore of this kind
must grow tiresome, and be necessarily marked
with an unfavourable degree of sameness;
unfavorable, I mean, with regard to the patience
of cold, dispassionate readers: for, taken
in another point of view, it seems to give
additional strength to the cause. Is it not a
strong presumptive proof of the veracity of
the circumstances that have been offered, that
a number of men, unknown to each other,
from different parts of the kingdom, dating
their facts so long asunder, bringing their scenes
of destruction from different places and vessels,
without an invitation, without interest
to serve, without any other purpose than that
of supporting the cause of humanity, should
concur in such a wonderful degree, that a
warm reader would be almost led to imagine,
that the observations were all made on one
voyage, and the misery and murder the produce
of the same vessel? And, yet, to a <i>multitude</i>
of proofs is opposed the simple unsupported
affirmation, that the practice is not general.
I have again to declare, that though I
made every possible inquiry, and had the very
best opportunity for those inquiries, on the
coast, in the West Indies, and in England, I
never heard but of <i>one</i> Guinea vessel, in which
the usage and conduct were in any degree of
<span class="pageno target" title="77" id="page-77"></span>
moderation. The lists were filled with famine,
flogging, torture, and every horrid species of
wanton barbarity and oppression.
</p>

<p>
I will not, Sir, press any farther upon your
time. I hope you will excuse the inaccuracies
to be found in these letters, and if I should
have appeared either warm or earnest, let it
be remembered how hard it is to be cold in
such a cause; that these remarks have not
been compiled from the patient and laborious
stores of collected evidence; but come warm
from a heart that has felt the miseries it describes,
and from a recollection, that still smarts
with the barbarities it has witnessed.
